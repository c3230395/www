    <div class="range">
        <div id="section1">
            <h2>Section1</h2>
            <p>This is the first box. It has a light blue background,<br>
             rounded corners, and a solid border. <br>
             This box includes an image below to<br>
             enhance the visual appeal of the content.<br>
             The image should be relevant to the content described and help illustrate the point.</p>
            <img src="images/section1.jpg" alt="Section 1 Image">
        </div>

        <div id="section2">
            <h2>Section2</h2>
            <p>This is the second box. It has a light orange background,<br>
               slightly rounded corners, a solid border, and a shadow.<br> 
               Including an<br>
               image in this box helps break up the text and provides a visual example of the content.<br> 
               The use of CSS box shadow enhances the<br>
               3D effect of this box.</p>

            <p>This is the third box. It has a light purple background,<br>
               no rounded corners, and a dashed border.<br> 
               This box also includes an image,<br>
               which helps to demonstrate how different styles and borders can be applied to create distinct visual sections within a webpage.</p>
