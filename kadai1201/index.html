        <p>This is the first box. It has a light blue background, rounded corners, and a solid border. This box includes an image below to<br>
        enhance the visual appeal of the content. The image should be relevant to the content described and help illustrate the point.</p>

    <div id="section2">
        <h2>Section2</h2>
        <p>This is the second box. It has a light orange background, slightly rounded corners, a solid border, and a shadow. Including an<br>
        image in this box helps break up the text and provides a visual example of the content. The use of CSS box shadow enhances the<br>
        3D effect of this box.</p>
